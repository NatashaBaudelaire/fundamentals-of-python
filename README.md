## Covered Topics

### 1. Algorithms and Programming Logic

- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)  
- Loops (`for`, `while`)  
- Mathematical operations  
- String manipulation  
- Input and output  

### 2. Object-Oriented Programming

- Classes and objects  
- Encapsulation

---

## Technologies Used

- **Language:** Python 3.x  
- **Recommended Tools:**  
  - IDEs: PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook  
  - Linters/Formatters: `flake8`, `black`  
- **Version Control:** Git (hosted on GitHub)

## How to Run Examples

All examples are written in Python and saved as standalone `.py` files.

**From the terminal:**

1. Navigate to the appropriate folder:  
```bash
python filename.py
```

> Replace `filename.py` with the actual file name.

Alternatively, you can utilise the built-in run/debug tools in your preferred IDE.

## Code Style Guide

* **File Names:** `snake_case.py` (e.g., `calculate_area.py`)
* **Functions & Variables:** `snake_case` (e.g., `get_user_input`)
* **Classes:** `CamelCase` (e.g., `BankAccount`)
* **Constants:** `UPPER_CASE_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `PI_VALUE`)
* Indentation: 4 spaces
* Write meaningful comments where necessary
* Use `black` or `flake8` for formatting and linting

---

## Repository Guidelines

* Include only Python-related content relevant to the topics
* Maintain clean, efficient, and well-documented code
* Use consistent naming conventions for files and directories
* Write clear and descriptive commit messages
* Never commit virtual environments, cache files, or sensitive information
* Include instructions or sample input/output where needed
