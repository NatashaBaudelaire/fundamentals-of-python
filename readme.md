## Study Context

- **Classroom Activities:** Exercises and projects completed with instructor support  
- **Homework Assignments:** Independent tasks to reinforce key concepts  
- **Self-Study:** Personal projects and coding challenges for deeper understanding  
- This repository represents the consolidation of knowledge gained across these varied learning experiences.

---

## Objectives

- Master essential programming principles using Python  
- Enhance logical reasoning and problem-solving skills  
- Apply object-oriented programming techniques effectively  
- Build a solid foundation for advanced programming and real-world applications  

---

## Technologies Used

- **Language:** Python 3.x  
- **Recommended Tools:**  
  - IDEs: PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook  
  - Linters/Formatters: `flake8`, `black`  
- **Version Control:** Git (hosted on GitHub)

## How to Run Examples

All examples are written in Python and saved as standalone `.py` files.

**From the terminal:**

1. Navigate to the appropriate folder:  
```bash
python filename.py
````

> Replace `filename.py` with the actual file name.

Alternatively, open the file in your preferred IDE and run it directly using the built-in tools.

## Code Style Guide

* **File Names:** `snake_case.py` (e.g., `calculate_area.py`)
* **Functions & Variables:** `snake_case` (e.g., `get_user_input`)
* **Classes:** `CamelCase` (e.g., `BankAccount`)
* **Constants:** `UPPER_CASE_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `PI_VALUE`)
* Indentation: 4 spaces
* Add docstrings and meaningful comments
* Use `black` or `flake8` for formatting and linting

* Keep code clean, efficient, and well-commented
* Follow folder and naming conventions
* Write clear and concise commit messages
* Never commit virtual environments, cache files, or sensitive information
* Include instructions or sample input/output where needed
